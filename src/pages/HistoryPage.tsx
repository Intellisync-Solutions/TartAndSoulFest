// Founder story paragraphs
const FOUNDER_STORY = [
  "As a certified event planner, I've always believed in the magic of bringing people together through unforgettable experiences. But Tart & Soul is more than just an event—it's a piece of my heart, a tribute to my roots, and a celebration of the things that have always made me feel at home: soul food, soul music, and my mom's love for butter tarts.",
  "Growing up, butter tarts were my mom's absolute favourite treat. No matter what kind of day she was having, one bite of that buttery, gooey goodness would instantly bring a smile to her face. That smile is something I'll never forget. It wasn't just about the sweetness of the dessert—it was about the comfort, the tradition, and the simple joys that food can bring.",
  "But food was only part of it. Music was the heartbeat of our home. Whether it was soul, R&B, or the timeless sounds of Motown, music was always playing in the background at my nana's home or my family home, setting the mood for everything from Sunday dinners to spontaneous dance parties in the kitchen. And of course, there was the food—rich, flavourful, Southern-inspired dishes that brought our family together and told stories of our heritage with every bite.",
  "As I built my career in event planning, I knew I wanted to create something that blended all these passions together—something that celebrated community, culture, and connection. That's how Tart & Soul was born.",
  "This festival is my way of sharing the joy, warmth, and nostalgia that butter tarts, soul music, and great food have always brought to my life. It's a space where people can come together, enjoy incredible flavours, dance to the rhythm of soulful beats, and celebrate the rich cultural influences that make food and music so powerful.",
  "Most of all, I hope Tart & Soul brings you the same kind of happiness that I remember so vividly on my mom's face. Because at the end of the day, that's what this festival is all about—good food, good music, and good vibes that make you smile from the inside out."
